**Last Updated:** January 13, 2025

## Overview

New Tab Redirector is a Chrome extension developed by Kilian Barbier that allows users to customize their new tab page by redirecting to any URL of their choice. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in relation to your use of our extension.

## Information We Collect

### Data We DO NOT Collect

**We do not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal information.** Specifically:

- ❌ We do not collect browsing history
- ❌ We do not collect personal identification information
- ❌ We do not collect website usage data
- ❌ We do not track user behavior
- ❌ We do not use analytics services
- ❌ We do not collect search queries

### Data We Store Locally

The extension stores the following information **locally on your device only**:

- ✅ **Your custom redirect URL** - The website URL you choose for your new tab page
- ✅ **First-time setup flag** - A simple indicator to show onboarding only once

Via the site the extension redirects to (by default `https://newtab.kilianbarbier.fr/en/`):
- ✅ **Your custom redirect URL** - The website URL you choose for your new tab page
- ✅ **Pinned shortcut URLs** - URLs of shortcuts you choose to pin to your new tab page
- ✅ **Weather location** - The city you choose for weather display

This data is stored using Chrome's local storage API and **never leaves your device**.

## How We Use Information

The locally stored information is used solely to:

1. **Remember your URL preference** - To redirect new tabs to your chosen website
2. **Provide onboarding** - To show the setup process only on first use
3. **Extension functionality** - To ensure the extension works as intended

## Data Sharing

**We do not share any data with third parties** because we don't collect any data to share.

- ❌ No data is transmitted to our servers
- ❌ No data is sold to advertisers
- ❌ No data is shared with analytics companies
- ❌ No data is provided to third-party services

## Permissions Explanation

Our extension requests minimal permissions:

### Storage Permission
- **Purpose**: To save your custom URL preference locally on your device
- **Scope**: Local storage only, no cloud synchronization of personal data
- **Data**: Only your chosen redirect URL and setup status

### Chrome URL Override Permission
- **Purpose**: To replace the default new tab page with our redirect functionality
- **Scope**: Only affects new tab behavior

## Third-Party Services

### Default Redirect URL

### Custom URLs
- When you set a custom URL, you will be redirected to that website
- We are not responsible for the privacy practices of websites you choose to visit

## Data Security

Since we don't collect or transmit data:

- ✅ Your URL preference is stored locally and encrypted by Chrome
- ✅ No data transmission means no risk of data breaches from our side
- ✅ Your data remains under your control at all times

## Your Rights and Choices

### Data Control
